# Vibe-Coded Website Clone

A hilarious parody website scraped from [vibe-coded.lol](https://vibe-coded.lol/) using **Firecrawl MCP**.

## What is this?

This is a perfect clone of the satirical "Every Fucking AI-Coded Website Ever" - a website that brilliantly parodies the cookie-cutter landing pages that people generate using AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT without understanding the code.

## How was this created?

This was scraped using **Firecrawl MCP** (Model Context Protocol) integrated with Cursor IDE. The entire website was extracted in seconds, including:

- ✅ Full HTML structure
- ✅ All styling (Bootstrap + custom CSS)
- ✅ External links and references
- ✅ Images (via external URLs)
- ✅ JavaScript functionality

## Firecrawl MCP Test Results

**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESS**

The Firecrawl MCP integration worked flawlessly:
- Connected to the Firecrawl API via MCP
- Successfully scraped the entire website
- Retrieved markdown, HTML, and all links
- Used 1 credit from Firecrawl API

## How to View

Simply open `index.html` in any web browser:

```bash
# Windows
start index.html

# Mac
open index.html

# Linux
xdg-open index.html
```

Or just double-click the `index.html` file.
